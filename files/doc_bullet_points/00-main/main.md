# Testing Bullet Points

**Bullet point list un-numbered (bold):**

A small intro text (non-bold) followed by a bullet point list:

* A bullet point
* Another bullet point
* A third bullet point
  * A sub bullet point
  * Another sub bullet point

Bullet point list numbered:

1. A bullet point
2. Another bullet point
3. A third bullet point
   1. A sub bullet point
   2. Another sub bullet point
   3. A third sub bullet point

Then a standalone paragraph.


Then a second paragraph with some air between itself and the previous text.
It is closely followed by another sentence.
