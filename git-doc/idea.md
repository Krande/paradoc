# Git (Para)Doc

The general idea is to point to any git repository containing a markdown files and use paradoc to:

- [ ] show the content in a web page
- [ ] return a single markdown file with all the content
- [ ] return a single docx file with all the content
- [ ] return a single pdf file with all the content

With paradoc you can also add variables in your markdown that can be linked to external data sources and replaced, 
such as:

- [ ] images from an azure storage blob
- [ ] table data from a database (sql/nosql)
- [ ] text (or any type of) data from a database (sql/nosql)
